One Simple TExt COmpletor


<h1>What is Osteco</h1>

<p>Osteco is a straightforward text editor that lets you create/modify text files with the addition of a "word guess" service, to help you type faster.</p>
<p>The collection of words used to perform this task is either one you build up yourself from scratch and save for later use, or one given to you by using a Spiun database of words for a language of your choice if supported, hosted at the <a href="https://spiun.net">Spiun website</a></p>
